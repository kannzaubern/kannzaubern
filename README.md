I'm Stephanie. I'm a Digital **Product Designer** based in Berlin, Germany. I come from a **Product Management** background and worked as a PO for 6 years before transitioning to design.

After work, you can find me 👩‍🍳 in the kitchen, playing 🎾 or cuddling with my 🐶 Alaska. She's adorable, but very sneaky.
